# Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism

## Overview

This project is part of the GRIP (The Sparks Foundation) Data Science and Business Analytics Internship (September 2023). The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the "globalterrorismdb" dataset, with the objective of gaining insights into global terrorism trends, including hotspots, the number of casualties, the most active terrorist organizations, and more.

## Project Description

### Task 4: Exploratory Data Analysis

In this project, we perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the "globalterrorismdb" dataset, which contains information about various terrorist incidents around the world. The primary aim is to uncover patterns and insights from the data.

The EDA process is divided into three sections:

### Section 1: Importing Required Libraries

In this section, we import the necessary Python libraries and read the dataset for analysis. We also perform some initial data cleaning steps to prepare the data for analysis.

### Section 2: Exploratory Data Analysis

In this section, we explore and analyze the dataset to extract meaningful insights. Some of the key analyses performed include:

- Analyzing the number of terror attacks over the years.
- Examining terrorist activities by region in each year.
- Identifying the top countries affected by terrorism.
- Analyzing the number of casualties (deaths and injuries) due to terrorist attacks.
- Exploring the types of attacks and their frequencies.
- Investigating the top terrorist groups and the number of attacks they carried out.
- Identifying the most lethal terrorist attacks.
- Geospatial analysis of terrorism incidents.

### Section 3: Conclusion and Results

This section summarizes the key findings and conclusions from the EDA. It provides insights such as the countries and cities most affected by terrorism, the most active terrorist groups, and the types of attacks that cause the most casualties.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project, "globalterrorismdb," contains a comprehensive record of terrorist incidents worldwide and is provided as part of the project.

## Requirements

To run the code and perform your own analysis, you will need the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

You can install these libraries using `pip` or `conda` as follows:
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/tanmaygadre/TSF_EDA_Terrorism

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd TSF_EDA_Terrorism

3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook file named `Exploratory Data Analysis on Terrorism.ipynb` to reproduce the EDA and analysis.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into global terrorism trends, helping us understand the geographical and temporal patterns of terrorist activities and the methods used by terrorist groups. The analysis can be further extended and customized to gain more specific insights and inform counter-terrorism efforts.

Feel free to explore the Jupyter Notebook for a detailed walkthrough of the analysis.
